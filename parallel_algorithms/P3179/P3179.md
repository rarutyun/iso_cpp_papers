# Abstract # {- .unlisted}

This paper proposes adding parallel algorithms that work together with the C++ Ranges library.

# Motivation # {#motivation}

Standard parallel algorithms with execution policies which set semantic requirements to user-provided callable objects
were a good start for supporting parallelism in the C++ standard.

The C++ Ranges library - ranges, views, etc. - is a powerful facility to produce lazily evaluated pipelines
that can be processed by range-based algorithms. Together they provide a productive and expressive API
with the room for extra optimizations.

Combining these two powerful features by adding support for execution policies to the range-based algorithms opens
an opportunity to fuse several computations into one parallel algorithm call, thus reducing the overhead on parallelism.
That is especially valuable for heterogeneous implementations of parallel algorithms, for which the range-based API helps
reducing the number of kernels submitted to an accelerator.

Users are already using ranges and range adaptors by passing range iterators to the existing non-range parallel
algorithms. [@P2408R5] was adopted to enable this. This pattern is often featured when teaching C++ parallel algorithms
and appears in many codebases.

`iota` and `cartesian_product` are especially common, as many compute workloads want to iterate over indices, not
objects, and many work with multidimensional data. `transform` is also common, as it enables fusion of element-wise
operations into a single parallel algorithm call, which can avoid the need for temporary storage and is more
performant than two separate calls.

However, passing range iterators to non-range algorithms is unwieldy and verbose. It is surprising to
users that they cannot simply pass the ranges to the parallel algorithms as they would for serial algorithms.

Earlier, [@P2500R2] proposed to add the range-based C++ parallel algorithms together with its primary goal of extending
algorithms with schedulers. We have decided to split those parts to separate papers, which could progress independently.

# Design overview # {#design_overview}

This paper proposes execution policy support for C++ range-based algorithms. In the nutshell, the proposal extends C++
range algorithms with overloads taking any standard or implementation defined C++ execution policy as a function parameter.
These overloads are further referred to as *parallel range algorithms*.

The proposal is targeted to C++26.

## Design summary ## {#design_summary}

### Differences to serial range algorithms ### {#design_diff_to_cpp20_ranges}

Comparing to the C++20 serial range algorithms, we propose the following modifications:

- The execution policy parameter is added, supporting all standard and implementation-defined execution policies.
  See [](#supported_policies).
- `for_each` and `for_each_n` return only an iterator but not the function. See [](#return_type).
- Parallel range algorithms take a range, not an iterator, as the output for the overloads with ranges, and additionally take
    an output sentinel for the "iterator and sentinel" overloads. See [](#range_as_the_output).
- Until better parallelism-friendly abstractions are proposed, parallel algorithms require `random_access_{iterator,range}`.
  See [](#random_access_requirement).
- All input and output data sequences must be bounded. See [](#require_bounded_ranges).

### Differences to C++17 parallel algorithms ### {#design_diff_to_cpp17_par}

In addition to data sequences being passed as either ranges or "iterator and sentinel" pairs, the following differences
to the C++17 parallel algorithms are proposed:

- `for_each` returns an iterator, not `void`.
- Algorithms require `random_access_{iterator,range}`, and not *LegacyForwardIterator*.
- All input and output data sequences must be bounded.

### Other design aspects ### {#design_other_aspects}

- Except as mentioned above, the parallel range algorithms should return the same type as the corresponding serial range
  algorithms. See [](#return_type).
- The proposed algorithms extend the overload set of algorithm function objects defined in `std::ranges`.
  See [](#algorithm_func_objects).
- The proposed algorithms should require callable object passed to an algorithm to be `regular_invocable` where possible.
  See [](#callable_parameters).
- The proposed algorithms should follow the design of C++17 parallel algorithms with regard to `constexpr` support.
  See [](#constexpr_support).

### An example of the proposed API ### {#design_api_example}

The proposed API will look like the following (using `transform` as an example):

```cpp
template<@_execution-policy_@ Ep, random_access_iterator I, sized_sentinel_for<I> S,
         random_access_iterator O, sized_sentinel_for<O> OutS,
         copy_constructible F, class Proj = identity>
  requires indirectly_writable<O, indirect_result_t<F&, projected<I, Proj>>>
  ranges::unary_transform_result<I, O>
    ranges::transform(Ep&& exec, I first, S last, O result, OutS result_last,
                      F op, Proj proj = {});

template<@_execution-policy_@ Ep, ranges::@_random-access-sized-range_@ R, ranges::@_random-access-sized-range_@ OutR,
         copy_constructible F, class Proj = identity>
  requires indirectly_writable<ranges::iterator_t<OutR>, indirect_result_t<F&, projected<ranges::iterator_t<R>, Proj>>>
  ranges::unary_transform_result<ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<R>, ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<OutR>>
    ranges::transform(Ep&& exec, R&& r, OutR&& result, F op, Proj proj = {});
```

The used exposition-only concepts are described below.

## Coexistence with schedulers ## {#coexistence_with_schedulers}

We believe that adding parallel range algorithms does not have the risk of conflict with anticipated scheduler-based
algorithms, because an execution policy does not satisfy the requirements for a policy-aware scheduler [@P2500R2],
a sender [@P3300R0], or really anything else from [@P2300R10] that can be used to specify such algorithms.

At this point we do not, however, discuss how the appearance of schedulers
may or should impact the execution rules for parallel algorithms specified in
[algorithms.parallel.exec]{- .sref},
and just assume that the same rules apply to the range algorithms with execution policies.

## Supported execution policies ## {#supported_policies}

Parallel range algorithms should operate with the same set of execution policies as the existing parallel algorithms,
that is, `seq`, `unseq`, `par`, and `par_unseq` in the `std::execution` namespace, as well as any implementation-defined
execution policies.

The following exposition-only concept simplifies constraining the algorithms with proper execution policy types:

```cpp
template<class Ep>
concept @_execution-policy_@ = @_`// exposition only`_@
    is_execution_policy_v<remove_cvref_t<Ep>>;
```

We do not propose the parallel range algorithms to be customizable for application-defined execution policies.
We expect such custom policies to become unnecessary once the standard algorithms are capable of working with
schedulers/senders/receivers.

## Algorithm return types ## {#return_type}

We explored possible algorithm return types and came to conclusion that returning the same type as serial range
algorithms is the preferred option to make the changes for enabling parallelism minimal.

```cpp
auto res = std::ranges::sort(v);
```

becomes:

```cpp
auto res = std::ranges::sort(std::execution::par, v);
```

However, `std::ranges::for_each` and `std::ranges::for_each_n` require special consideration because previous
design decisions suggest that there should be a difference between serial and parallel versions.

The following table summarizes return value types for the existing variants of these two algorithms:

API                                                     Return type
---                                                     -----------
`std::for_each`                                         `Function`
Parallel `std::for_each`                                `void`
`std::for_each_n`                                       `Iterator`
Parallel `std::for_each_n`                              `Iterator`
`std::ranges::for_each`                                 `for_each_result<ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<Range>, Function>`
`std::ranges::for_each`, `I` + `S` overload             `for_each_result<Iterator, Function>`
`std::ranges::for_each_n`                               `for_each_n_result<Iterator, Function>`


While the serial `std::for_each` returns the obtained function object with all modifications it might have accumulated,
the return type for the parallel `std::for_each` is `void` because, as stated in the standard, "parallelization often
does not permit efficient state accumulation". For efficient parallelism an implementation can make multiple copies of
the function object, which for that purpose is allowed to be copyable and not just movable like for the serial `for_each`.
That implies that users cannot rely on any state accumulation within that function object, so it does not make sense
(and might be even dangerous) to return it.

In `std::ranges`, the return type of `for_each` and `for_each_n` is unified to return both an iterator and the function
object.

Based on the analysis above and [the feedback from SG9](#sg9_tokyo_2024) we think that the most reasonable return type
for parallel variants of `std::ranges::for_each` and `std::ranges::for_each_n` should be:


API                                                        Return type
---                                                        -----------
Parallel `std::ranges::for_each`                           `ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<Range>`
Parallel `std::ranges::for_each`, `I` + `S` overload       `Iterator`
Parallel `std::ranges::for_each_n`                         `Iterator`

## Extending the overload sets of algorithm function objects ## {#algorithm_func_objects}

We believe the proposed functionality should have the same properties and general behavior as serial range algorithms,
particularly regarding the name lookup.

With the adoption of [@P3136R0], function templates in the `std::ranges` namespace have been respecified as
*algorithm function objects*. These objects are defined as sets of one or more overloaded function templates,
which names designate the objects.

The parallel range algorithms we propose will extend the overload sets for the respective algorithm function objects.
The name lookup rules for such objects will apply automatically. It is covered by the wording proposed in [@P3136R0];
additional changes are not needed.

From the implementation standpoint, adding parallel versions of the range algorithms to the overload set should not be
a problem. Please see [](#possible_impl) for more information.

## Requiring `random_access_iterator` or `random_access_range` ## {#random_access_requirement}

C++17 parallel algorithms minimally require *LegacyForwardIterator* for data sequences, but in our opinion, it is not quite
suitable for an efficient parallel implementation. Therefore for parallel range algorithms we propose to require
random access ranges and iterators.

Using parallel algorithms with forward ranges will in most cases give little to no benefit,
and may even reduce performance due to extra overheads. We believe that forward ranges and iterators are bad abstractions
for parallel data processing, and allowing those could result in wrong expectations and unsatisfactory user experience
with parallel algorithms.

Many parallel programming models that are well known and widely used in the industry, including OpenMP, OpenCL, CUDA,
SYCL, oneTBB, define iteration or data spaces for their parallel constructs in ways that allow creating sufficient
parallel work quickly and efficiently. A key property for this is the ability to split the work into smaller chunks.
These programming models allow to control the amount of work per chunk and sometimes the ways chunks are created
and/or scheduled. All these also support iteration spaces up to at least 3 dimensions.

Except for `tbb::parallel_for_each` in oneTBB which can work with forward iterators, these parallel programming models
require random access iterators or some equivalent, such as numeric indexes or pointers. This is natural,
as referring to an arbitrary point in the iteration space at constant time is the main and by far simplest way
to create parallel work. Forward iterators, on the other hand, are notoriously bad for splitting a sequence
that can only be done in linear time. Moreover, if the output of an algorithm should preserve the order of its input,
which is typical for the C++ algorithms, it requires additional synchronization or/and additional space with forward
iterators and comes almost for granted with random access ones.

These very programming models are often used as backends to implement the C++ standard parallelism. Not surprisingly,
most implementations fall back to serial processing if data sequences have no random access. Of the GNU libstdc++,
LLVM libc++, and MSVC's standard library, only the latter attempts to process forward iterator based sequences in parallel,
for which it first needs to serially iterate over a whole sequence once or even twice.
oneAPI DPC++ library (oneDPL) supports forward iterators only for a very few algorithms,
only for `par` and only in the implementation based on oneTBB.

According to the SG1/SG9 feedback we have got earlier, there seemingly are two main reasons why others do not want to restrict
parallel algorithms by only random access ranges:

- That would prevent some useful views, such as `filter_view`, from being used with parallel range algorithms.
- That would be inconsistent with the C++17 parallel algorithms.

Given the other aspects of the proposed design, we believe some degree of inconsistency with C++17 parallel algorithms
is inevitable and should not become a gating factor for important design decisions.

The question of supporting the standard views that do not provide random access is very important. We think though
that it should better be addressed through proper abstractions and new concepts defining iteration spaces, including
multidimensional ones, suitable for parallel algorithms. We intend to work on developing these (likely in another paper),
however it requires time and effort to make it right, and we think trying to squeeze that into C++26 adds significant risks.
For now, random access ranges with known bounds (see [](#require_bounded_ranges)) is probably the best approximation
that exists in the standard. Starting from that and gradually enabling other types of iteration spaces
in a source-compatible manner seems to us better than blanket allowance of any `forward_range`.

## Taking range as the output ## {#range_as_the_output}

We propose taking a range as the output for the overloads that take ranges for input.
Similarly, we propose requiring a sentinel for the output where the input is passed as "iterator and sentinel".

The benefits of this *range-as-the-output* approach, comparing to taking a single iterator for the output, are:

- It creates a safer API where all data sequences have known bounds. Specifically, the `sized_range`
    and `sized_sentinel_for` concepts will be applied to the output sequences in the same way as to the input sequences.
- Not for all algorithms the output size is defined by the input size. An example is `copy_if` (and similar
    algorithms with *filtering* semantics), where the output sequence might be shorter than the input one.
    Knowing the expected size of the output may open opportunities for more efficient implementations.
- Passing a range for the output makes code a bit simpler in the cases typical for parallel execution.

On the joint SG1 and SG9 discussion of [@P3179R2] the audience expressed several concerns about the idea and
[requested to stay with iterators for the output](#sg1_sg9_st_louis_2024) until deeper investigation is made.

To address the concerns, we wrote a separate paper [@P3490R0] with the detailed investigation of the topic,
suggesting there a compromise solution with adding separate function template overloads for both *iterator-as-the-output*
and *range-as-the-output*. See [@P3490R0] for more details.

Eventually SG9 [accepted](#sg9_wroclaw_2024) our original proposal to use ranges for the output, without extra overloads
for legacy convenience.

## Requiring ranges to be bounded ## {#require_bounded_ranges}

One of the requirements we want to put on the parallel range algorithms is to disallow unbounded input and output.
The reasons for that are:

- For efficient parallel implementation we need to know the iteration space bounds. Otherwise, it's hard to
    apply the "divide and conquer" strategy for creating work for multiple execution threads.
- While serial range algorithms allow passing an "infinite" range like `std::ranges::views::iota(0)`,
    it may result in an endless loop. It's hard to imagine usefulness of that in the case of parallel execution.
    Requiring data sequences to be bounded potentially prevents errors at run-time.
- Using explicitly bounded output ranges follows established practices of secure coding, which recommend or even
    require to always specify the size of the output in order to prevent out-of-range data modifications.

If several provided ranges or sequences are bounded, an algorithm should stop as soon as the end is reached for the shortest one.
There are already precedents in the standard that an algorithm takes two sequences with potentially different input sizes
and chooses the smaller size as the number of iterations it is going to make, such as `std::ranges::transform`
and `std::ranges::mismatch`. For the record, `std::transform` (including the overload with execution policy) doesn't support
different input sizes, while `std::mismatch` does.

In the case of two input ranges or sequences, for a few algorithms - namely, `mismatch`, `equal`, and `transform` -
it could be sufficient for just one range to be bounded and the other assumed to have at least as many elements
as the bounded one. This enables unbounded ranges such as `views::repeat` in certain useful patterns, for example:

```cpp
void normalize_parallel(range auto&& v) {
  auto mx = reduce(execution::par, v, ranges::max{});
  transform(execution::par, v, views::repeat(mx), v.begin(), divides);
}
```

However, SG9 [decided](#sg9_wroclaw_2024) to require `sized_range` for all inputs, with the plan to relax these constraints
for `transform` once there is a way to statically detect infinite ranges like `views::repeat` (as opposed to finite unsized
ranges, such as null terminated strings).

The exposition-only concept _`random-access-sized-range`_ combines the key requirements to the types of ranges
to simplify the signatures of parallel range algorithms:

```cpp
template<class R>
concept @_random-access-sized-range_@ = @_`// exposition only`_@
    ranges::random_access_range<R> && ranges::sized_range<R>;
```

## Requirements for callable parameters ## {#callable_parameters}

In [@P3179R0] we proposed that parallel range algorithms should require function objects for predicates, comparators, etc.
to have `const`-qualified `operator()`, with the intent to provide compile-time diagnostics for mutable	function objects
which might be unsafe for parallel execution. We have got contradictory feedback from SG1 and SG9 on that topic:
SG1 preferred to keep the behavior consistent with C++17 parallel algorithms, while SG9 supported our design intent.

We did extra investigation and decided that requiring `const`-qualified operator at compile-time is not strictly necessary
because:

- The vast majority of the serial range algorithms requires function objects to be `regular_invocable` (or its derivatives),
    which already has the semantic requirement of not modifying either the function object or its arguments.
    While not enforced at compile-time, it seems good enough for our purpose because it demands having the same function
    object state between invocations (independently of `const` qualifier), and it is consistent with serial range algorithms.
- Remaining algorithms should be considered individually. For example, `for_each` using a mutable `operator()` is of less
    concern if the algorithm does not return the function object (see more detailed analysis below).
    For `generate`, a non-mutable callable appears to be of very limited use: in order to produce multiple values while not
    taking any arguments, a generator should typically maintain and update some state.

The following example works fine for serial code. While it compiles for parallel code, users should not assume that the
semantics remains intact. Since the parallel version of `for_each` requires function object to be copyable, it
is not guaranteed that all `for_each` iterations are processed by the same function object. Practically speaking, users
cannot rely on accumulating any state modifications in a parallel `for_each` call.

```cpp
struct callable
{
    void operator()(int& x)
    {
        ++x;
        ++i; // a data race if the callable is executed concurrently
    }
    int get_i() const {
        return i;
    }
private:
    int i = 0;
};

callable c;

// serial for_each call
auto fun = std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), c);

// parallel for_each call
// The callable object cannot be read because parallel for_each version purposefully returns void
std::for_each(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end(), c);

// for_each serial range version call
auto [_, fun] = std::ranges::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), c);
```

We allow the same callable to be used in the proposed `std::ranges::for_each`.

```cpp
// callable is used from the previous code snippet
callable c;
// The returned iterator is ignored
std::ranges::for_each(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end(), c);
```

Again, even though `c` accumulates state modifications, one cannot rely on that because an algorithm implementation
is allowed to make as many copies of `c` as it wants. Of course, this can be overcome by using `std::reference_wrapper`
but that might lead to data races.

```cpp
// callable is used from the previous code snippet
// Wrapping a callable object with std::reference_wrapper compiles, but might result in data races
callable c;
std::ranges::for_each(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end(), std::ref(c));
```

Our conclusion is that it's user responsibility to provide such a callable that avoids data races, same as for C++17 parallel
algorithms.

## `constexpr` parallel range algorithms ## {#constexpr_support}

[@P2902R0] suggests allowing algorithms with execution policies to be used in constant expressions.
We do not consider that as a primary design goal for our work, however we will happily align with that proposal
in the future once it progresses towards adoption into the working draft.

# More examples # {#more_examples}

## Change existing code to use parallel range algorithms ## {#easy_to_switch}

One of the goals is to require a minimal amount of changes when switching from the existing API to parallel range
algorithms. However, that simplicity should not create hidden issues negatively impacting the overall user experience.
We believe that the proposal provides a good balance in that regard.

As an example, let's look at using `for_each` to apply a lambda function to all elements of a `std::vector v`.

For the serial range-based `for_each` call:

```cpp
std::ranges::for_each(v, [](auto& x) { ++x; });
```

switching to the parallel version will look like:

```cpp
std::ranges::for_each(std::execution::par, v, [](auto& x) { ++x; });
```

In this simple case, the only change is an execution policy added as the first function argument. It will also hold for
the "iterator and sentinel" overload of `std::ranges::for_each`.

The C++17 parallel `for_each` call:

```cpp
std::for_each(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end(), [](auto& x) { ++x; });
```

can be changed to one of the following:

```cpp
// Using iterator and sentinel
std::ranges::for_each(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end(), [](auto& x) { ++x; });

// Using vector as a range
std::ranges::for_each(std::execution::par, v, [](auto& x) { ++x; });
```

So, here only changing the namespace is necessary, though users might also change `v.begin(), v.end()` to just `v`.

However, for other algorithms more changes might be necessary.

## Less parallel algorithm calls and better expressiveness ## {#less_parallel_call}

Let's consider the following example:

```cpp
reverse(policy, begin(data), end(data));
transform(policy, begin(data), end(data), begin(result), [](auto i){ return i * i; });
auto res = find_if(policy, begin(result), end(result), pred);
```

It has three stages and eventually tries to answer the question if the input sequence contains an element after reversing
and transforming it. The interesting considerations are:

- Since the example has three parallel stages, it adds extra overhead for parallel computation per algorithm.
- The first two stages will complete for all elements before the `any_of` stage is started, though it is not required for
    correctness. If reverse and transformation would be done on the fly, a good implementation of `any_of` might have
    skipped the remaining work when `pred` returns `true`, thus providing more performance.

Let's make it better:

```cpp
// With fancy iterators
auto res = find_if(policy,
                  make_transform_iterator(make_reverse_iterator(end(data)),
                                          [](auto i){ return i * i; }),
                  make_transform_iterator(make_reverse_iterator(begin(data)),
                                          [](auto i){ return i * i; }),
                  pred);
```

Now there is only one parallel algorithm call, and `any_of` can skip unneeded work. However, this
variation also has interesting considerations:

- First, it doesn't compile. We use `transform iterator` to pass the transformation function,
    but the two `make_transform_iterator` expressions use two different lambdas, and
    the iterator type for `any_of` cannot be deduced because the types of `transform_iterator` do not match.
    One of the options to make it compile is to store a lambda in a variable.
- Second, it requires using a non-standard iterator.
- Third, the expressiveness of the code is not good: it is hard to read while easy to make a mistake
    like the one described in the first bullet.

Let's improve the example further with the proposed API:

```cpp
// With ranges
auto res = find_if(policy, data | views::reverse | views::transform([](auto i){ return i * i; }),
                  pred);
```

The example above lacks the drawbacks described for the previous variations:

- There is only one algorithm call;
- The implementation might skip unnecessary work;
- There is no room for the lambda type mistake;
- The readability is much better compared to the second variation and not worse than in the first one.

# Possible implementation of a parallel range algorithm # {#possible_impl}

## Out-of-scope ## {#out_of_scope}

### The counterparts of exiting algorithms without `ExecutionPolicy` ### {#without_exec_policy_counterpart}

Below we list the algorithms below without `ExecutionPolicy` in C++17 and where `ExecutionPolicy` parameter doesn't seem
to add value:

- `push_heap`
- `pop_heap`
- `sort_heap`
- `next_permutation`
- `prev_permutation`
- `lower_bound`
- `upper_bound`
- `equal_range`
- `binary_search`
- `partition_point`

Below we list the algorithms below without `ExecutionPolicy` in C++17, where `ExecutionPolicy` parameter might make sense
but requires deeper investigation:

- `iota`
- `make_heap`
- `is_permutation`
- `copy_backward`
- `move_backward`
- `sample` (RNG specific)
- `shuffle` (RNG specific)

Below we list `std::ranges` only algorithms where we don't add the `ExecutionPolicy` parameter:

- `fold_left`
- `fold_left_first`
- `fold_right`
- `fold_right_last`
- `fold_left_with_iter`
- `fold_left_first_with_iter`
- `generate_random` (RNG specific, `ExecutionPolicy` parameter was rejected during [@P1068R11] review)

### Absence of some serial range-based algorithms ### {#serial_range_based_absence}

We understand that some useful algorithms do not yet exist in `std::ranges`, for example, most of generalized numeric
operations [numeric.ops]{- .sref}. The goal of this paper is however limited to
adding overloads with `ExecutionPolicy`  to the existing algorithms in the `std::ranges` namespace. Any follow-up paper
that adds `<numeric>` algorithms to `std::ranges` should also consider adding dedicated overloads with `ExecutionPolicy`.

# Implementation experience # {#impl_exp}

The oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) [developer guide](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDPL/parallel_api/parallel_range_algorithms.html)
covers parallel range algorithms we’ve implemented so far. The oneAPI specification provides
[formal signatures](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneAPI-spec/blob/main/source/elements/oneDPL/source/parallel_api/parallel_range_api.rst)
of these algorithms. The implementation supports execution policies for CPUs (semantically aligned with the C++ standard)
and for SYCL devices, and it works with a subset of the standard C++ views.

We use the range-as-the-output approach where applicable: in `transform`, `copy`, `copy_if`, and `merge`.

We don't foresee any issues with implementability for the rest of the proposed parallel algorithms because all of them were
already implemented in C++17 and new APIs that we propose are expressible via the existing ones.

# Further work # {#further_work}

## Issues to address ## {#issues_to_address}

Having known bugs and feedback from SG1 and SG9, the plan of work prior to the next committee F2F meeting in
Austria, 2025 is the following:

- ~~Update [algorithm.syn]{- .sref}.~~
- ~~Add the algorithm descriptions to the wording, even if no changes are made.~~
- ~~Add random-access-sized-range as an exposition-only concept~~
- ~~Use the old feature testing macro~~
- ~~Shorten the exec policy parameter + italicize the exposition only context~~
- Add mentioning of `result_last` or similar for the algorithms where range-as-an-output and a novelty (`copy`, `transform`, etc.)
- ~~Add sentinel-for-output for `copy_n` algorithm family.~~
- Clarify that views can be copied by parallel algorithms
- The thread safety rules for `begin()/end()` should be like for element access function
- Add testing experience of thread safe access to the views
- ~~Add short descriptions of the new exposition-only concepts to the design overview.~~
- ~~Fix cross-references~~
- In [algorithms.parallel.defns]{- .sref}, maybe Mention "ranges" next to iterators etc.

## LWG questions ## {#lwg_questions}

- C++17 `<memory>` Parallel Algorithms exist in the `<memory>` synopsis only. Should it be fixed?
- namespace `ranges` is used (or not used) inconsistently, in our opinion. Need an advice.
- For `partial_sort_copy` range-as-an-output is called `R2`. For `uninitialized_copy` and `uninitialized_move` it's called `OS`.
  For the new wording we call is `OutR`. We should probably align. The same is true for sentinel-for-output.
- `ExecutionPolicy` function parameter is named `exec` everywhere, except two places where the name is `policy`. Should it be fixed?
- `starts_with`, `ends_with` misses dot at the end of _Returns_. It should be fixed, right?
- `find_last` doesn't have `T = projected_value`... in the synopsis. It must be a bug.
- Serial `replace_copy_if` does not have indent for the second row of function parameters.
- `unique_copy` wording uses *`N`* but its never defined.
- `shift_left` doesn't have extra 'Returns' word in *Returns* section
- `nth_element` in *Effects* says *were* sorted. Should it be *was*?
- `inplace_merge` *Remarks* is not consistent with the rest, doesn't have the same link to [algorithm.stable]{- .sref}.
- `find_end` defines `n` after it's used for the first time. Is it ok? The same is for `equal`.

## Thread-safe views examination ## {#thread_safe_views}

We need to understand better whether using some `views` with parallel algorithms might result in data races.
While some investigation was done by other authors in [@P3159R0], it's mostly not about the data races but about
ability to parallelize processing of data represented by various views.

We need to invest more time to understand the implications of sharing a state between `view` and `iterator` on the possibility
of data races. One example is `transform_view`, where iterators keep pointers to the function object that is stored
in the view itself.

Here are questions we want to answer (potentially not a complete list):

- Do users have enough control to guarantee absence of data races for such views?
- Are races not possible because of implementation strategy chosen by standard libraries?
- Do we need to add extra requirements towards thread safety to the standard views?

## Modify [algorithms.parallel.defns]{- .sref} ## {#modify_alg_parallel_def}

[2]{.pnum} A *parallel algorithm* is a function template listed in this [document]{.rm}[Clause]{.add} with
a[n *execution policy* ([execpol]{- .sref})]{.add} template parameter named `ExecutionPolicy` [or `@_execution-policy_@ Ep`]{.add}.

[3]{.pnum} Parallel algorithms access objects indirectly accessible via their arguments by invoking the following functions:

- All operations of the categories of the iterators[, sentinels,]{.add} or mdspan types that the algorithm is instantiated with.
- Operations on those sequence elements that are required by its specification.
- User-provided [function]{.rm}[invocable]{.add} objects to be applied during the execution of the algorithm, if required by the specification.

with the specified default predicate or operation (where applicable) shall not directly or indirectly modify objects via their arguments,
nor shall they rely on the identity of the provided objects.

## Modify [algorithms.parallel.exec]{- .sref} ## {#modify_alg_parallel_exec}

[1]{.pnum} Parallel algorithms have template parameters named `ExecutionPolicy` [or `@_execution-policy_@ Ep`]{.add} ([execpol]{- .sref})

they apply the element access functions.

## Modify [algorithms.parallel.exceptions]{- .sref} ## {#modify_alg_parallel_exceptions}

[2]{.pnum} During the execution of a parallel algorithm, if the invocation of an element access function exits
via an uncaught exception, the behavior is determined by the [`ExecutionPolicy`]{.rm}[execution policy]{.add}.

## Modify [algorithms.parallel.overloads]{- .sref} ## {#modify_alg_parallel_overloads}

[1]{.pnum} Parallel algorithms are algorithm overloads. Each parallel algorithm overload has an additional template
type parameter named `ExecutionPolicy` [or `@_execution-policy_@ Ep`]{.add}, which is the first template parameter.
Additionally, each parallel algorithm overload has an additional function parameter of type `ExecutionPolicy&&`

:::

[1]{.pnum} Let *`N`* be `(last1 - first1) + (last2 - first2)`. Let `comp` be `less{}`, `proj1` be `identity{}`, and
`proj2` be `identity{}`, for the overloads with no parameters by those names.

[2]{.pnum} *Preconditions*: The ranges `[first1, last1)` and `[first2, last2)` are sorted with respect to
`comp` and `proj1` or `proj2`, respectively. The resulting range does not overlap with either of the original ranges.

[3]{.pnum} *Effects*: Copies all the elements of the two ranges `[first1, last1)` and `[first2, last2)` into the range
`[result, result_last)`, where `result_last` is `result + @_N_@`. If an element `a` precedes `b` in an input range,
`a` is copied into the output range before `b`. If `e1` is an element of `[first1, last1)` and `e2` of `[first2, last2)`,
`e2` is copied into the output range before `e1` if and only if `bool(invoke(comp, invoke(proj2, e2), invoke(proj1, e1)))`
is `true`.

[4]{.pnum} *Returns*:

- [4.1]{.pnum} `result_last` for the overloads in namespace `std`.
- [4.2]{.pnum} `{last1, last2, result_last}` for the overloads in namespace `ranges`.

[5]{.pnum} *Complexity*:

- [5.1]{.pnum} For the overloads with no `ExecutionPolicy`, at most `@_N_@ − 1` comparisons and applications of each projection.
- [5.2]{.pnum} For the overloads with an `ExecutionPolicy`, `@_O_@(@_N_@)` comparisons.

[6]{.pnum} *Remarks*: Stable ([algorithm.stable]{- .sref}).

```
:::

[7]{.pnum} Let `comp` be `less{}` and `proj` be `identity{}` for the overloads with no parameters by those names.

[8]{.pnum} *Preconditions*: `[first, middle)` and `[middle, last)` are valid ranges sorted with respect to `comp` and
`proj`. For the overloads in namespace `std`, `BidirectionalIterator` meets the *Cpp17ValueSwappable* requirements
([swappable.requirements]{- .sref}) and the type of `*first` meets the *Cpp17MoveConstructible* (Table 31) and
*Cpp17MoveAssignable* (Table 33) requirements.

[9]{.pnum} *Effects*: Merges two sorted consecutive ranges `[first, middle)` and `[middle, last)`, putting the result of
the merge into the range `[first, last)`. The resulting range is sorted with respect to `comp` and `proj`.

[10]{.pnum} *Returns*: `last` for the overload in namespace `ranges`.

[11]{.pnum} *Complexity*: Let `@_N_@ = last - first`:

- [11.1]{.pnum} For the overloads with no `ExecutionPolicy`, and if enough additional memory is available, exactly
  `@_N_@ − 1` comparisons.
- [11.2]{.pnum} Otherwise, `@_O_@(@_N_@log@_N_@)` comparisons.

In either case, twice as many projections as comparisons.

[12]{.pnum} *Remarks*: Stable.

  constexpr borrowed_iterator_t<R>
    ranges::inplace_merge(R&& r, iterator_t<R> middle, Comp comp = {}, Proj proj = {});

*Effects*: Equivalent to: `return ranges::inplace_merge(ranges::begin(r), middle, ranges::end(r), comp, proj);`

:::

[1]{.pnum} Let `comp` be `less{}`, and `proj1` and `proj2` be `identity{}` for the overloads with no parameters by those
names.

[2]{.pnum} *Preconditions*: The ranges `[first1, last1)` and `[first2, last2)` are sorted with respect to `comp` and `proj1`
or `proj2`, respectively. The resulting range does not overlap with either of the original ranges.

[3]{.pnum} *Effects*: Copies the elements of the range `[first1, last1)` that are not present in the range
`[first2, last2)`, and the elements of the range `[first2, last2)` that are not present in the range `[first1, last1)` to
the range beginning at `result`. The elements in the constructed range are sorted.

[4]{.pnum} *Returns*: Let `result_last` be the end of the constructed range. Returns

- [4.1] `result_last` for the overloads in namespace `std`.
- [4.2] `{last1, last2, result_last}` for the overloads in namespace `ranges`.

[5]{.pnum} *Complexity*: At most `2 * ((last1 - first1) + (last2 - first2)) - 1` comparisons and applications of each
projection.

[6]{.pnum} *Remarks*: Stable ([algorithm.stable]{- .sref}). If `[first1, last1)` contains *`m`* elements that are
equivalent to each other and `[first2, last2)` contains *`n`* elements that are equivalent to them, then `|@_m_@ − @_n_@|`
of those elements shall be copied to the output range: the last `@_m_@ − @_n_@` of these elements from `[first1, last1)`
if `@_m_@ > @_n_@`, and the last `@_n_@ − @_m_@` of these elements from `[first2, last2)` if `@_m_@ < @_n_@`. In either
case, the elements are copied in order.

## SG1, Wroclaw, 2024 ## {#sg1_wroclaw_2024}

Forward [@P3179R3] to LEWG with the following notes:

1. The intention is that algorithms call `begin`/`end` only once, in serial code
     (we do not think any new words are needed)
2. The intention is that `mismatch`, `transform` and `equal` assume the unsized range
     is at least as large as the sized one (UB / precondition) or require && sized
