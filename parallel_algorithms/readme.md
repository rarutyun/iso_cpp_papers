## P3179
**C++ parallel range algorithms**

The paper proposes adding parallel algorithms that work together with the C++ Ranges library.

At the F2F meeting in February 2025, LEWG forwarded P3179R6 to LWG for C++26.
At a telecon on 2025-05-23, LWG polled P3179R9 to put into C++26: 11-0-0 Unanimous consent.
The proposal was then approved by the C++ committee to be added to the C++ standard working draft for C++26.
